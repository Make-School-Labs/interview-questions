## 8 

Write a function that draws a sine wave it should take in

## 9 

Write the function below. It should take in an x and y 
and an array of 4 arrays. 

Do not assume that the block will map to the grid. 

```
mapBlockToGrid(x, y, block) {
  ... 
  return [...] // new grid array with block mapped at x and y
}

var block = [
  [0,1,0,0], 
  [0,1,1,0], 
  [0,0,1,0], 
  [0,0,0,0]
]

// Example the block above should map to the grid below. 

mapBlockToGrid(4, 3, block)

[
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
